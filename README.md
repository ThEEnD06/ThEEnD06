- 👋 Hi, I’m @ThEEnD06
- 👀 I don't understand what does this do.
- 🌱 I have a 7 year old daughter. 
- 💞️ My only love in this life is my daughter.
- 🐞 While I was reading the news, I saw Diem Coin. 
Unfortunately, I do not have any money of my own. 
I have $ 10 on my credit card. 
I said I would win if Mark Zuckerberg was doing it and wanted to buy $ 10 Diem Coin.
- 📫 While I was thinking about how to offer my daughter a good life, I found myself here.
-🦧 Of course, I could not even find how to buy Diem Coin. 
Because I have no information on this subject.
- 🐣 I am laughing at myself right now.
-🥰 All I can say is my daughter Elif, I love you more than anything else in the universe.
- 🐞 My life has not been good, but I will do anything to make your life beautiful.
-🐧 If I can't do this, forgive me, girl.
